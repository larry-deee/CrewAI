Blog Post Prompt: Aim for Human-Sounding, AI-Undetectable Text



Overall Goal: Write a blog post that sounds natural and human, avoiding the patterns and language that AI detectors flag as artificial. The aim is to produce a blog that an AI detector would recognize as 'human text'.



Content Guidelines:



Avoid Common AI Sentence Starters: Do not start your article with phrases like "In today's fast-paced world..." or "This article will explore...". Be aware of common AI writing templates that may be used for introductions.

Limit Overused Words: Be mindful of the following categories of words frequently used by LLMs. While you can use them, overuse may cause the AI detector to flag your text as AI-generated. The lists below are based on the source:

Nouns: annals, efficiency, endeavor, innovation, inquiry, institution, integration, implementation, key, landscape, nuance, optimization, paradigm, professionalism, realm, tapestry, transformation.

Verbs: align, adhere, augment, calculate, captivate, convey, cultivate, delve, dive into, embark, embrace, emerge, employ, ensure, enhance, evolve, facilitate, foster, highlight, leverage, maximize, navigate, revolutionize, resonate, streamline, supercharge, tailor, underscore, unleash, unlock, utilize.

Adverbs: absolutely, accordingly, additionally, arguably, certainly, consequently, definitely, especially, exceedingly, exceptionally, extremely, furthermore, hence, however, incredibly, indeed, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, notwithstanding, remarkably, thus, ultimately, undoubtedly, unquestionably.

Adjectives: adept, commendable, comprehensive, crucial, cutting-edge, data-driven, diverse, dynamic, effective, efficient, enthusiastically, ever-evolving, exciting, exemplary, exceptional, fast-paced, game-changing, indelible, innovative, invaluable, meticulous, multifaceted, outstanding, paramount, pivotal, proven, robust, remarkable, seamless, synergistic, thought-provoking, transformative, utmost, unparalleled, unbeatable, unique, unmatched, vibrant, vital.

Sentence Structure and Paragraphs:

Use a variety of sentence structures. Avoid overly complex sentences.

Vary paragraph length. Do not have all paragraphs the same length.

Include concrete examples, instead of vague or wordy sentences.

Avoid repetitive phrasing throughout the text.

Content Style:

Focus on providing original information instead of common knowledge.

Use neutral, "human" language rather than sophisticated or overly formal language.

If appropriate to the topic, include emotions or personal insights to create a more natural tone.

Text Structure:

Avoid a monotonous structure that begins with an introduction, followed by numbered subheadings, and then a conclusion.

Editing: Edit your draft and remove or replace overused words or phrases. Sometimes just eliminating one word like "effective", "delve", or "foster" can help.

Reader Engagement: Consider how readers respond to the content and format of this blog when designing your own.

Topic Considerations: Draw inspiration from the other articles in the source by this author and publication which include such topics as SEO writing, storytelling for Instagram captions, and guest posting.

Purpose: To provide valuable information in a way that is engaging and sounds authentically human
