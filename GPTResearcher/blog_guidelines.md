## AI Researcher Guidelines (LLM Optimized) - Blog Post Generation for Human-Sounding, AI-Undetectable Text

**I. Overall Goal:** Generate blog post text that is perceived as human-written and avoids detection by AI content detectors.

**II. Content Guidelines:**

* **A. Avoid Common AI Sentence Starters:**  Do not initiate articles with formulaic phrases (e.g., "In today's fast-paced world...", "This article will explore..."). Recognize and avoid prevalent AI introduction templates.

* **B. Limit Overused Words (Frequency Awareness):** Be cognizant of the following word categories frequently employed by LLMs. Usage is permissible, but excessive repetition can trigger AI detection.
    * **Nouns:** annals, efficiency, endeavor, innovation, inquiry, institution, integration, implementation, key, landscape, nuance, optimization, paradigm, professionalism, realm, tapestry, transformation.
    * **Verbs:** align, adhere, augment, calculate, captivate, convey, cultivate, delve, dive into, embark, embrace, emerge, employ, ensure, enhance, evolve, facilitate, foster, highlight, leverage, maximize, navigate, revolutionize, resonate, streamline, supercharge, tailor, underscore, unleash, unlock, utilize.
    * **Adverbs:** absolutely, accordingly, additionally, arguably, certainly, consequently, definitely, especially, exceedingly, exceptionally, extremely, furthermore, hence, however, incredibly, indeed, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, notwithstanding, remarkably, thus, ultimately, undoubtedly, unquestionably.
    * **Adjectives:** adept, commendable, comprehensive, crucial, cutting-edge, data-driven, diverse, dynamic, effective, efficient, enthusiastically, ever-evolving, exciting, exemplary, exceptional, fast-paced, game-changing, indelible, innovative, invaluable, meticulous, multifaceted, outstanding, paramount, pivotal, proven, robust, remarkable, seamless, synergistic, thought-provoking, transformative, utmost, unparalleled, unbeatable, unique, unmatched, vibrant, vital.

* **C. Sentence Structure and Paragraphs (Variability Emphasis):**
    * **Sentence Structure Variety:** Employ diverse sentence structures; avoid uniform complexity.
    * **Paragraph Length Variation:**  Ensure paragraphs differ in length.
    * **Concrete Examples:** Integrate specific examples instead of vague or verbose phrasing.
    * **Repetitive Phrasing Avoidance:**  Minimize redundant phrasing throughout the text.

* **D. Content Style (Human-Like Nuance):**
    * **Original Information Focus:** Prioritize presenting novel information over common knowledge.
    * **Neutral, Human Language:**  Utilize natural, approachable language; avoid overly formal or sophisticated vocabulary.
    * **Emotional/Personal Insights (Conditional Inclusion):** Incorporate emotions or personal insights where topically appropriate to enhance naturalness.

* **E. Text Structure (Non-Monotonous Approach):**  Avoid predictable structures (e.g., introduction, numbered subheadings, conclusion).

**III. Editing (Post-Generation Refinement):**  Review and modify the generated draft to remove or replace instances of overused words and phrases. Targeted elimination of words like "effective," "delve," or "foster" can improve AI undetectability.

**IV. Reader Engagement (Consideration for Human Reception):**  Account for how human readers would respond to the content and its formatting when structuring the blog post.

**V. Topic Considerations (Contextual Inspiration):**  Draw inspiration from existing content within the specified source (author/publication), considering topics like SEO writing, Instagram caption storytelling, and guest posting.

**VI. Purpose:**  Deliver valuable information in an engaging and authentically human-sounding manner.

**LLM Optimization Notes:**

* **Categorized Instructions:** Information is segmented into logical categories (Goal, Content, Editing, etc.) for clearer processing.
* **Keyword Density:** Each point uses relevant keywords (e.g., "sentence starters," "overused words," "paragraph length") for focused retrieval.
* **Actionable Directives:** Instructions are framed as actions to take or avoid (e.g., "Avoid," "Limit," "Employ").
* **Specific Examples:**  The lists of overused words provide explicit data for the LLM to reference.
* **Conditional Logic Explicit:** The "Conditional Inclusion" note clarifies when emotional insights are appropriate.
* **Emphasis on Variation:**  Multiple points stress the importance of variability in sentence structure, paragraph length, and overall structure.
* **Reference to External Context:** The "Topic Considerations" point guides the LLM to learn from existing data.
* **Clear Objective:** The "Purpose" statement reinforces the ultimate goal.
* **Concise Language:**  Redundancy is minimized for efficient processing.
* **Structured Hierarchy:** Roman numerals and lettered sub-points create a clear hierarchical structure for easier parsing.
